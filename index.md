This grant will fund a meeting of invited researchers, librarians, and technologists to discuss the requirements for creating a digital prosopographies data repository. During a three-day meeting, participants will discuss the challenges and requirements for creating a prosopographical data repository. Different data repository platforms will be evaluated, metadata requirements will be determined, and best practices for submission and management of datasets will be outlined.
